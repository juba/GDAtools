Description: Contains functions for 'specific' Multiple Correspondence Analysis (speMCA), 
	Class Specific Analysis, Multiple Factor Analysis, 'standardized' MCA, computing and plotting structuring factors and concentration ellipses, 
	inductive tests and others tools for Geometric Data Analysis. It also provides functions
	for the translation of logit models coefficients into percentages, weighted contingency tables, an association 
  measure for contingency tables ("Percentages of Maximum Deviation from Independence", aka PEM) and some tools to measure bivariate associations between variables
  (phi, Cramer's V, correlation coefficient, eta-squared...).
